                    <p style= "width: auto 50%; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; color:lightseagreen; padding: 20 px;"> I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our national poet.
                        Until then there was quite a rule on only using books and going to the almost inexistent library for school work. 
                         A classmate who made a comprehensive paper told me she found the info on Google.
                        So I go home and tell my parents to let me use the internet for school.
                        It was <b>frustrating</b> because it is about a Romanian poet, and the information is scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking for.
                        Furthermore, I always found the modem to be incredibly unaesthetic.
                        I never shared that thought though because I thought the benefit of having internet access outweighed its aesthetic downside.

                        I considerably improved my English by reading tech and science articles on Yahoo starting with the age of 10-11.
                        I read more than a handful a day and remember at that time I wanted to <b>design</b> devices myself.

                        I don’t remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, but I remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth.
                        We exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc.
                        I always got so frustrated when my Bluetooth didn’t work, which was almost always. But I got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song that I received.
                        This feeling of being able to share something with your friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.

                    I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but what I do remember was email using AOL.
                    My brother and I were still really young (around 6) and we would draw a lot.
                    My father lived in Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often would fax our drawings.
                    But that meant that my father always saw them in greyscale. Then we got an email account where we could scan and send our drawings to my father.
                    He finally got to see them in color and we could respond to our "artwork".
                    I remember being amazed by this and we were always very excited to check our email to see any comments (Mum always supervised us, she wasn't very trusting of the web!)
