      <h1>How We Remember The Web</h1>
      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>
        I remember my brother introduced me the web. He used to find the
        videos/movies and download them with super slow speed. When I firstly
        started using it, I had no idea how to search, cause google was not the
        first page. I can’t even remember what it was, but for sure I had to
        input google.com manually and then continue. After around 5 days
        expecting that smth can go wrong (get a virus or break a computer) I got
        so much excitement. I felt that I have limitless opportunities now. And
        I started spending a lot of hours surfing in web.

        I’d loved computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them
        in grade school. Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could do
        dot-matrix printing and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and to
        learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12
        years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. I had
        heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and that
        you could find pages about anything you could think of. I called him up
        and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight
        upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the modem made all
        its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first
        webpage load in slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny logo with the
        exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were categories for all
        kinds of things. We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to
        category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could
        find. That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death
        to get a computer for our home and it had to be one that could connect
        to the internet.

        I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I was
        actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet” on my
        computer.It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I’m old enough
        to remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn’t wait to create an
        E-Mail account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only
        other one of my classmates that had Internet already at this
        time.Funnily this new way of communication & connecting people that the
        Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after
        we discovered the world of chatrooms and were totally amazed of the
        possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time.

        So the first time I actually felt the internet was impactful of my life
        was back in the day was, before school introduced us to a computer
        showing us how to do reading AR test and some history games but it
        didn't mean much to me. So one day my friend comes to my house and he
        shows me a game called Runescape back in 2008 and I was curious to see
        what the game was. It was an MMORPG that opened the world to me to
        online chatting, gaming, sense of achievement when leveling or powering
        up my character and even meeting new friends. With that I was hooked
        then later he showed me how youtube was and how I could stream online
        videos on youtube. After some time I was so into Runescape I downloaded
        a Hypercam 2 screen recorder and started filming my youtube tutorials
        for power-up in the games and downloading video software to edit the
        video and uploading it , later I found private servers and I downloaded
        one and started to edit the code to make me owner of the server and
        that's how I got into coding. Also from the MMORPG genre started to
        introduce me to other games like WOW and later future games and new
        communities of people I have met online, youtube as well with the videos
        and then looking up coding tutorials and other places to grab
        information.

        I got my first computer in 2005. Operation System was Windows XP but the
        internet very very low speed. Was called Dial-Up modem which made creepy
        sounds and if someone calling, the internet immediately shot down) After
        one year, finally we have wi-fi router. One friend told me Microsoft
        introduced a new operation system Windows 7. I looked in Microsoft
        website (and yes it was my first web site) and I saw that Microsoft
        offers to download a new Windows Media Player free. It took me almost 4
        hours to get the .exe file. When I installed NEW WMP. That was a very
        different design from Windows XP and I liked it. At that moment I
        realized that web it’s powerful “tool”.
