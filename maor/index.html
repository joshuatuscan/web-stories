<p style="width:700px;">
<b>These are the stories of our first memories of when networked computers touched our lives.
It’s good to realize that this thing that’s been a part of life for so long is the same thing we can take part in building today</b>

<i>I’d loved computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them in grade school.</i><br /> 
Classrooms had  <a href="http://https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how-to-sell-trade-in-or-recycle-old-macs-or-pcs/"target="_blank"
>Old Macs</a> in them where you could do dot-matrix printing and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and to learn. 
I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12 years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. 
I had heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and that you could find pages about anything you could think of. 
I called him up and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the modem made all 
its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first webpage load in slowly. <b>Yahoo</b>. 
There was the funny logo with the exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were categories for all kinds of things.
We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could find. That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death to get a computer for our home and it had to be one that could connect to the internet.

I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I was actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet” on my computer.
It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I’m old enough to remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn’t wait to create an E-Mail account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only other one of my classmates that had Internet already at this time.
Funnily this new way of communication & connecting people that the Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after we discovered the world of chatrooms and were totally amazed of the possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time.

So the first time I actually felt the internet was impactful of my life was back in the day was, before school introduced us to a computer showing us how to do reading AR test and some history games but it didn't mean much to me. So one day my friend comes to my house and he shows me a game called Runescape back in 2008 and I was curious to see what the game was. It was an MMORPG that opened the world to me to online chatting, gaming, sense of achievement when leveling or powering up my character and even meeting new friends. With that I was hooked then later he showed me how youtube was and how I could stream online videos on youtube. After some time I was so into Runescape I downloaded a Hypercam 2 screen recorder and started filming my youtube tutorials for power-up in the games and downloading video software to edit the video and uploading it , later I found private servers and I downloaded one and started to edit the code to make me owner of the server and that's how I got into coding. Also from the MMORPG genre started to introduce me to other games like WOW and later future games and new communities of people I have met online, youtube as well with the videos and then looking up coding tutorials and other places to grab information.

I got my first computer in 2005. Operation System was Windows XP but the internet very very low speed. Was called Dial-Up modem which made creepy sounds and if someone calling, the internet immediately shot down) After one year, finally we have wi-fi router.  One friend told me Microsoft introduced a new operation system Windows 7.  I looked in Microsoft website (and yes it was my first web site) and I saw that Microsoft offers to download a new Windows Media Player free. It took me almost 4 hours to get the .exe file. When I installed NEW WMP. That was a very different design from Windows XP and I liked it. At that moment I realized that web it’s powerful “tool”.

I remember i used to use <b>Netscape</b>, It had an animation on its logo when it was searching. I remember It was so cofusing, tons of links
lots of text that was just put there without any order or thinking. But it was actualy amazing how you could find information or games using your finger only.
We used to download games also, so there where packs of sheaty games you could download. and Ill never forget the noise of the modem and the timer that indicates
 how long Im connected (couse they would charge you according to the time you use it.
) Yap, long time ago. <br/> <b>I remember it felt:</b>

<ul>
<li>Amazing</li>
<li>New</li>
<li>Cool</li>
<li>Confusing</li>
