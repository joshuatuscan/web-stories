    <h2>Era</h2>
    <p>
      I don't have a very clear memory of the first time I used the internet.
      What I do remember was that I absolutely fell in love with the idea of
      playing games online when I discovered the internet. I loved how colourful
      everything was and I loved how I get to move the characters around myself.

      My father would get upset if he saw us playing for a long time because the
      internet was very expensive at that time. I remember that power puff girls
      and barbie dress up were my most favourite games.

      I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I was
      actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet” on my
      computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I'm old enough to
      remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn't wait to create an E-Mail
      account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only other one
      of my classmates that had Internet already at this time.

      Funnily this new way of communication & connecting people that the
      Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after
      we discovered the world of chatrooms and were totally amazed of the
      possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time.

      I got my first computer in 2005. Operation System was Windows XP but the
      internet very very low speed. Was called Dial-Up modem which made creepy
      sounds and if someone calling, the internet immediately shot down) After
      one year, finally we have wi-fi router. One friend told me Microsoft
      introduced a new operation system Windows 7. I looked in Microsoft website
      (and yes it was my first web site) and I saw that Microsoft offers to
      download a new Windows Media Player free. It took me almost 4 hours to get
      the .exe file. When I installed NEW WMP. That was a very different design
      from Windows XP and I liked it. At that moment I realized that web it's
      powerful “tool”.

      My first experience using the internet is most likely a relatable one. I
      was in school, in Paris, and the teacher brought the entire class up to
      the computer room. I can't remember if the computers were just installed
      or if it was just the first time we where allowed to use them but I do
      recall that one particular student had some previous knowledge, mainly due
      to the fact that he knew how to bypass the school block and was able to
      get us straight to the most exciting games website. I remember the walls
      were orange but I have not the recollection of the computer we where using
      or what we were supposed to be doing (most likely something less exciting
      like WolframAlpha or paint). Once we got onto the games website I was
      blown away by the number of games I could play at my will, it was like an
      endless supply of fun to me and I was incredibly excited. It was clear at
      that moment that I had underestimated the internet.

      My mother had a Mac in the house which she mainly used to write, and I'm
      sure we had an internet connection at that time but I had never tried
      using it. To me, the computer was just a tool for work and there was
      nothing cool or desirable about that, I had no interest in them
      whatsoever. This obviously changed when I found all the games. Shooting
      aliens or just simple platformers… I was hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's my first real memory of using one and being excited by one.
      First, the thrill of being able to bypass the school block on forbidden
      websites then finding out that there where entire websites filled with
      thousands of games, my mind was blown.
