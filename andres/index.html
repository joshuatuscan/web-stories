        <strong>Andres</strong> : So the first time I actually felt the internet was impactful of my life was back in the day was, before school introduced us to a computer showing us how to do reading AR test and some history games but it didn't mean much to me. So one day my friend comes to my house and he shows me a game called Runescape back in 2008 and I was curious to see what the game was. It was an MMORPG that opened the world to me to online chatting, gaming, sense of achievement when leveling or powering up my character and even meeting new friends. With that I was hooked then later he showed me how youtube was and how I could stream online videos on youtube. After some time I was so into Runescape I downloaded a Hypercam 2 screen recorder and started filming my youtube tutorials for power-up in the games and downloading video software to edit the video and uploading it , later I found private servers and I downloaded one and started to edit the code to make me owner of the server and that's how I got into coding. Also from the MMORPG genre started to introduce me to other games like WOW and later future games and new communities of people I have met online, youtube as well with the videos and then looking up coding tutorials and other places to grab information.

        <strong>Joshua</strong>: I’d loved computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them in grade school. Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could do dot-matrix printing and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and to learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12 years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. I had heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and that you could find pages about anything you could think of. I called him up and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the modem made all its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first webpage load in slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny logo with the exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were categories for all kinds of things. We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could find. That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death to get a computer for our home and it had to be one that could connect to the internet.

    <p><h3><strong>Leah</strong>: I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but what I do remember was email using AOL. My brother and I were still really young (around 6) and we would draw a lot. My father lived in Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often would fax our drawings. But that meant that my father always saw them in greyscale. Then we got an email account where we could scan and send our drawings to my father. He finally got to see them in color and we could respond to our "artwork". I remember being amazed by this and we were always very excited to check our email to see any comments (Mum always supervised us, she wasn't very trusting of the web!)</p>

    <h3><strong>Wei</strong>: I believe my first interaction with the web was in my father’s office when they first installed a computer with windows95. I believe when the browser opened it was empty and then we would go to websites like sina.com, yahoo.com or sohu.com, which were the main digital publisher at the time (of course I had no idea what “digital publisher” meant at the time). I remember the “minimize” and “close” button on the top left (or right?) Was quite confusing, and my father was freaked out when he saw the window disappeared after I clicked on “_”. He would think I “broke” the computer.

        It was all text on the webpage, sight a few images, which we would click with the mouse to get to the content. It was kind of like reading newspapers and magazines, just with a bit more contents. The navigation was a bit confusing (or computers in general), that we would close the browser and reopen it to get to the content on the same website if we were “lost” and couldn’t find our way back to the main page. Back button, refresh button were magic to us and we were so scared just to use them too often, feeling it was like reusing a physical object which would eventually wear out and the computer will break down.
        
        Internet Explorer was, of course, the only way of browsing. The blue “e" icon was like a window to the world, center of the action, which magic happens when double clicked on.

        <strong>Olivia</strong>: I don’t remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, but I remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth. We exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc. I always got so frustrated when my Bluetooth didn’t work, which was almost always. But I got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song that I received. This feeling of being able to share something with your friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.
