    <h1>How We Remember The Web</h1>
        
    <p style="max-width:800px"> 
        These are the stories of our first memories of when networked computers touched our lives. 
        It’s good to realize that this thing that’s been a part of life 
        for so long is the same thing we can take part in building today.

        <h2 style="color:white; background-color:rgb(28, 167, 160); max-width: 800px" "> Joshua</h2>

        <p style="max-width: 800px">
            I’d <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">loved</b> computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them in grade school. 
            Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing">dot-matrix printing </a> and play Oregon Trail. 
            We used them to draw and to learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12 years old that my neighbor friend told me they got <i>the internet</i>. 
        </p>
            
        <p style="max-width: 800px">I had heard about <i>the internet</i>, that it connected you to information and that you could find pages about <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">anything you could think of</b>. 
            I called him up and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight upstairs to the office and sat down. 
            He connected and the modem made all its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first webpage load in slowly.

        <p align="center"; style="font-size:120%; color:purple"> Yahoo.</p>

        <p align="center"; style="max-width: 350px">

            There was the funny logo with the exclamation point. 
            The list of blue links. There were categories for all kinds of things. 
            We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could find. 
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p style="max-width: 800px">That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death to get a computer for our home and it had to be 
            one that could connect to the internet.

        <p style="max-width: 800px">
            
        I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since <b style="color:white; background-color:coral"> I was actually waiting </b>  for finally  <i>"getting installed the internet”</i> on my computer.
            
        It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3dem"> modem </a> (I’m old enough to remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn’t wait to create an E-Mail account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only other one of my classmates that had Internet already at this time.
            
        Funnily this <b style="color:white; background-color:coral"> new way of communication & connecting people </b> that the Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after we discovered the world of <b>chatrooms</b> and were totally amazed of the possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time.

        <p style="max-width: 800px"> 
        I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but what I do remember was email using <img src="https://s.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.de/assets-habd63fbfd8ee89781b3a375db91c3cef/images/nav/aol-logo-black.svg?h=c8ffe034a0bf85df974064577b2cde76" >

        <p style="max-width: 800px"> My brother and I were still really young (around 6) and we would draw a lot. 
        My father lived in Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">would fax our drawings</b>. 
        But that meant that my father always saw them in greyscale. Then we got an email account where we could scan and send our drawings to my father. 
        He <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">finally got to see them in color </b>and we could respond to our "artwork". I remember being amazed by this and we were always very excited to check our email to see any comments 
        (Mum always supervised us, she wasn't very trusting of the web!)

            <p style="max-width: 800px"> I don’t remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, 
                but I remember a time in my childhood where it was <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">all about Bluetooth. </b> 
                We exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc. I always got so frustrated when my Bluetooth didn’t work, which was almost always. But I got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song that I received. This feeling of being able to share something with your friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.

            <h2 style="color:white; background-color:rgb(28, 167, 160); max-width: 800px"> Daniela</h2>

            <h3>First time I browsed the web</h3>
            
            <p style="max-width: 400px">
                    

                    I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our national poet. Until then there was quite a rule on only using books and going to the almost inexistent library for school work.
                    
                    A classmate who made a comprehensive paper told me she <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">found the info on Google.</b> So I go home and tell my parents to let me use the internet for school
                    
                    It was frustrating because it is about a Romanian poet, and the information is scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking for. Furthermore, I always found the modem to be incredibly unaesthetic. I never shared that thought though because I thought the benefit of having internet access outweighed the visual handicap.
                    
            </p>

            <h3>Early impact of the internet</h3>
            
            <p style="max-width: 400px">
            
            I considerably <b style="color:white; background-color:coral">improved my English by reading tech and science articles</b> on Yahoo starting with the age of 10-11. I read more than a handful a day and remember at that time I wanted to design devices myself.
