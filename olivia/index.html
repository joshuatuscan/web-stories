        I’d <strike>liked</strike> <strong>loved computers</strong> for a long
        time, ever since I was introduced to them in grade school. Classrooms
        had old Macs in them where you could do dot-matrix printing and play

        it was one day when I was 12 years old that my neighbor friend told me
        they got the internet. I had heard about the internet, that it connected
        you to information and that you could find pages about anything you
        could think of. I called him up and asked if I could come over. When I
        got there we ran straight upstairs to the office and sat down. He
        connected and the modem made all its <strong>weird sounds</strong> and
        then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first webpage load in
        slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny logo with the exclamation point. The
        list of blue links. There were categories for all kinds of things. We
        spent the next <strong>4 hours</strong> clicking from category to
        category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could
        find. That evening I started my campaign of
        <strong>annoying my parents to death</strong> to get a computer for our
        home and it had to be one that could connect to the internet.

        I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I was
        actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet” on my
        computer. It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I’m
        <b>old enough to remember</b> the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn’t
        wait to create an E-Mail account for being able to send my
        <b>very first</b> E-Mail to the only other one of my classmates that had
        Internet already at this time. <b>Funnily</b> this new way of
        <b>communication & connecting people</b> that the Internet provided was
        the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after we discovered the
        world of <b>chatrooms</b> and were totally amazed of the possibility to
        talk to people somewhere in real-time.

        I got my first computer in 2005. Operation System was Windows XP but the
        internet
        <strong>very very low speed</strong>. Was called Dial-Up modem which
        made <strong>creepy sounds</strong> and if someone calling, the internet
        immediately shot down) After one year, finally we have wi-fi router. One
        friend told me Microsoft introduced a new operation system Windows 7. I
        looked in Microsoft website (<strong
          >and yes it was my first web site</strong
        >) and I saw that Microsoft offers to download a new Windows Media
        Player free. It took me almost <strong>4 hours</strong> to get the .exe
        file. When I installed NEW WMP. That was a very different design from
        Windows XP and <strong>liked it</strong>. At that moment I realized that
        web it’s <strong>powerful “tool”</strong>.

        I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but
        what I do remember was email using AOL. My brother and I were
        <b>still really young</b> (around 6) and we would <b>draw a lot</b>. My
        father lived in Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often would
        fax our drawings. But that meant that my father always saw them in
        <b>greyscale</b>. Then we got an email account where we could scan and
        send our drawings to my father. He finally got to see them in
        <b>color</b> and we could respond to our "artwork". I remember being
        amazed by this and we were always <b>very excited</b> to check our email
        to see any comments (Mum always supervised us,
        <b>she wasn't very trusting of the web!</b>)

        I don’t remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, but I
        remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth. We
        exchanged ringtones, <strong>cool</strong> background pictures, etc. I
        always got so <strong>frustrated</strong> when my Bluetooth didn’t work,
        which was almost always. But I got such <strong>joy</strong> when it
        worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own as well or the new
        background wallpaper or just listen to the song that I received. This
        feeling of being able to
        <strong>share <strike>something</strike> anything</strong> with your
        friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a
        computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.
