        So the first time I actually felt the internet was impactful of my life was back in the day was, before school introduced us to a computer showing us how to do reading AR test and some history games but it didn't mean much to me. So one day my friend comes to my house and he shows me a game called Runescape back in 2008 and I was curious to see what the game was. It was an MMORPG that opened the world to me to online chatting, gaming, sense of achievement when leveling or powering up my character and even meeting new friends. With that I was hooked then later he showed me how youtube was and how I could stream online videos on youtube. After some time I was so into Runescape I downloaded a Hypercam 2 screen recorder and started filming my youtube tutorials for power-up in the games and downloading video software to edit the video and uploading it , later I found private servers and I downloaded one and started to edit the code to make me owner of the server and that's how I got into coding. Also from the MMORPG genre started to introduce me to other games like WOW and later future games and new communities of people I have met online, youtube as well with the videos and then looking up coding tutorials and other places to grab information.
