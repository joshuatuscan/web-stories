        I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I was actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet” on my computer.<br />
        <br /> It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I’m old enough to remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn’t wait to create an E-Mail account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only other one of my classmates that had Internet already at this time.<br />
        <br />Funnily this new way of communication and connecting people that the Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly after we discovered the world of chatrooms and were totally amazed of the possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time. <br />
