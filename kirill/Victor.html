        My first experience using the internet is most likely a relatable one. I was in school, in Paris, and the teacher brought the entire class up to the computer room. I can’t remember if the computers were just installed or if it was just the first time we where allowed to use them but I do recall that one particular student had some previous knowledge, mainly due to the fact that he knew how to bypass the school block and was able to get us straight to the most exciting games website. I remember the walls were orange but I have not the recollection of the computer we where using or what we were supposed to be doing (most likely something less exciting like WolframAlpha or paint). Once we got onto the games website I was blown away by the number of games I could play at my will, it was like an endless supply of fun to me and I was incredibly excited. It was clear at that moment that I had underestimated the internet.<br />
        <br />My mother had a Mac in the house which she mainly used to write, and I’m sure we had an internet connection at that time but I had never tried using it. To me, the computer was just a tool for work and there was nothing cool or desirable about that, I had no interest in them whatsoever. This obviously changed when I found all the games. Shooting aliens or just simple platformers… I was hooked.<br />
        <br />So that’s my first real memory of using one and being excited by one. First, the thrill of being able to bypass the school block on forbidden websites then finding out that there where entire websites filled with thousands of games, my mind was blown.<br />
