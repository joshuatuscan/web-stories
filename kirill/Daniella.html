        <i>First time I browsed the web</i>
        <br />
        <br />I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our national poet. Until then there was quite a rule on only using books and going to the almost inexistent library for school work.<br />
        <br />A classmate who made a comprehensive paper told me she found the info on Google. So I go home and tell my parents to let me use the internet for school.<br />
        <br /> It was frustrating because it is about a Romanian poet, and the information is scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking for. Furthermore, I always found the modem to be incredibly unaesthetic. I never shared that thought though because I thought the benefit of having internet access outweighed the visual handicap.<br />
        <br /><i>Early impact of the internet</i><br />
        <br />I considerably improved my English by reading tech and science articles on Yahoo starting with the age of 10-11. I read more than a handful a day and remember at that time I wanted to design devices myself.
