      Remininscing on how we were introduced to the internet and what impact it

      There are still people around who remember a world before the internet. A
      world where our lives were not intertwined with technology.

        I’d loved computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to them
        in grade school. Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could do
        dot-matrix printing and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and to
        learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was 12
        years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. I had
        heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and that
        you could find pages about anything you could think of. I called him up
        and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran straight
        upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the modem made all
        its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I watched the first
        webpage load in slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny logo with the
        exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were categories for all
        kinds of things. We spent the next 4 hours clicking from category to
        category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of wild sites we could
        find. That evening I started my campaign of annoying my parents to death
        to get a computer for our home and it had to be one that could connect
        to the internet.

        I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our
        national poet. Until then there was quite a rule on only using books and
        going to the almost inexistent library for school work. A classmate who
        made a comprehensive paper told me she found the info on Google. So I go
        home and tell my parents to let me use the internet for school It was
        frustrating because it is about a Romanian poet, and the information is
        scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking for. Furthermore, I
        always found the modem to be incredibly unaesthetic. I never shared that
        thought though because I thought the benefit of having internet access
        outweighed the visual handicap. I considerably improved my English by
        reading tech and science articles on Yahoo starting with the age of
        10-11. I read more than a handful a day and remember at that time I
        wanted to design devices myself.

        I don’t remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, but I
        remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth. We
        exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc. I always got so
        frustrated when my Bluetooth didn’t work, which was almost always. But I
        got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own
        as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song that
        I received. This feeling of being able to share something with your
        friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a
        computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.

        To be honest I don't remember the first time I used the internet because
        as I remember it always was there. Though, I remember some funny stories
        about how I was learning to understand what is it and how it works. So I
        am going to write about one of them. As I already mentioned, the
        Internet was existing since I was born, and when I was 5 years old I
        remember that my family had one super old computer, which looked like a
        big plastic box, and a more new version of computer, which was already
        quite flat. Everyone, of course, was using the new one because it was
        faster and better, and I, as the smallest person in the family was left
        to play with an old one. Apparently, the new computer was connected to
        the internet and I was observing my parents searching web, so I knew
        everything about how it looked inside and how to use it. Well, at least
        I thought that I knew everything. And one day, playing around the old
        computer I found the icon of Internet Explorer and I was sure that this
        icon means that I can access the internet. And being very excited about
        my discovery I decided to search for something. When I clicked on it
        nothing happened because the computer was not connected to any network
        but for a moment I thought that I broke something in the computer
        because I was thinking that you can install the "Internet" on your
        computer like all the other programs. I came to my parents with this
        story and they explained to me that the internet is not just one
        program.

      <h3>What about me?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but
        what I do remember was email using AOL. My brother and I were still
        really young (around 6) and we would draw a lot. My father lived in
        Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often would fax our
        drawings. But that meant that my father always saw them in greyscale.
        Then we got an email account where we could scan and send our drawings
        to my father. He finally got to see them in color and we could respond
        to our "artwork". I remember being amazed by this and we were always
        very excited to check our email to see any comments (Mum always
        supervised us, she wasn't very trusting of the web!)
