        <h2>First time I browsed the web</h2>
        <p>
          I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our
          national poet. Until then there was quite a rule on only using books
          and going to the almost inexistent library for school work. A
          classmate who made a comprehensive paper told me she found the info on
          Google. So I go home and tell my parents to let me use the internet
          for school It was frustrating because it is about a Romanian poet, and
          the information is scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking
          for. Furthermore, I always found the modem to be incredibly
          unaesthetic. I never shared that thought though because I thought the
          benefit of having internet access outweighed the visual handicap.
        </p>

        <h2 class="secondparagraph">Early impact of the internet</h2>
        <p>
          I considerably improved my English by reading tech and science
          articles on Yahoo starting with the age of 10-11. I read more than a
          handful a day and remember at that time I wanted to design devices
          myself.

        <h2>First time I browsed the web</h2>
        <p>
          I'd loved computers for a long time, ever since I was introduced to
          them in grade school. Classrooms had old Macs in them where you could
          do dot-matrix printing and play Oregon Trail. We used them to draw and
          to learn. I stayed fascinated for years, but it was one day when I was
          12 years old that my neighbor friend told me they got the internet. I
          had heard about the internet, that it connected you to information and
          that you could find pages about anything you could think of. I called
          him up and asked if I could come over. When I got there we ran
          straight upstairs to the office and sat down. He connected and the
          modem made all its weird sounds and then he opened up Netscape and I
          watched the first webpage load in slowly. Yahoo. There was the funny
          logo with the exclamation point. The list of blue links. There were
          categories for all kinds of things. We spent the next 4 hours clicking
          from category to category and from page to page, seeing what kinds of
          wild sites we could find. That evening I started my campaign of
          annoying my parents to death to get a computer for our home and it had
          to be one that could connect to the internet.

        <h2>The first time I actually felt the internet was impactful</h2>
        <p>
          So the first time I actually felt the internet was impactful of my
          life was back in the day was, before school introduced us to a
          computer showing us how to do reading AR test and some history games
          but it didn't mean much to me. So one day my friend comes to my house
          and he shows me a game called Runescape back in 2008 and I was curious
          to see what the game was. It was an MMORPG that opened the world to me
          to online chatting, gaming, sense of achievement when leveling or
          powering up my character and even meeting new friends. With that I was
          hooked then later he showed me how youtube was and how I could stream
          online videos on youtube. After some time I was so into Runescape I
          downloaded a Hypercam 2 screen recorder and started filming my youtube
          tutorials for power-up in the games and downloading video software to
          edit the video and uploading it , later I found private servers and I
          downloaded one and started to edit the code to make me owner of the
          server and that's how I got into coding. Also from the MMORPG genre
          started to introduce me to other games like WOW and later future games
          and new communities of people I have met online, youtube as well with
          the videos and then looking up coding tutorials and other places to
          grab information.

        <h2>My first experience using the internet</h2>
        <p>
          My first experience using the internet is most likely a relatable one.
          I was in school, in Paris, and the teacher brought the entire class up
          to the computer room. I can't remember if the computers were just
          installed or if it was just the first time we where allowed to use
          them but I do recall that one particular student had some previous
          knowledge, mainly due to the fact that he knew how to bypass the
          school block and was able to get us straight to the most exciting
          games website. I remember the walls were orange but I have not the
          recollection of the computer we where using or what we were supposed
          to be doing (most likely something less exciting like WolframAlpha or
          paint). Once we got onto the games website I was blown away by the
          number of games I could play at my will, it was like an endless supply
          of fun to me and I was incredibly excited. It was clear at that moment
          that I had underestimated the internet.
          <br />
          My mother had a Mac in the house which she mainly used to write, and
          I'm sure we had an internet connection at that time but I had never
          tried using it. To me, the computer was just a tool for work and there
          was nothing cool or desirable about that, I had no interest in them
          whatsoever. This obviously changed when I found all the games.
          Shooting aliens or just simple platformersâ€¦ I was hooked. <br />
          So that's my first real memory of using one and being excited by one.
          First, the thrill of being able to bypass the school block on
          forbidden websites then finding out that there where entire websites
          filled with thousands of games, my mind was blown.

        <h2>I'm not sure if this was the first time</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not sure if this was the first time I interacted with the web but
          what I do remember was email using AOL. My brother and I were still
          really young (around 6) and we would draw a lot. My father lived in
          Switzerland while we were in Germany, so we often would fax our
          drawings. But that meant that my father always saw them in greyscale.
          Then we got an email account where we could scan and send our drawings
          to my father. He finally got to see them in color and we could respond
          to our "artwork". I remember being amazed by this and we were always
          very excited to check our email to see any comments (Mum always
          supervised us, she wasn't very trusting of the web!)

        <h2>I thought you can instal your internet</h2>
        <p>
          To be honest I don't remember the first time I used the internet
          because as I remember it always was there. Though, I remember some
          funny stories about how I was learning to understand what is it and
          how it works. So I am going to write about one of them.
          <br />
          As I already mentioned, the Internet was existing since I was born,
          and when I was 5 years old I remember that my family had one super old
          computer, which looked like a big plastic box, and a more new version
          of computer, which was already quite flat. Everyone, of course, was
          using the new one because it was faster and better, and I, as the
          smallest person in the family was left to play with an old one.
          Apparently, the new computer was connected to the internet and I was
          observing my parents searching web, so I knew everything about how it
          looked inside and how to use it. Well, at least I thought that I knew
          everything. And one day, playing around the old computer I found the
          icon of Internet Explorer and I was sure that this icon means that I
          can access the internet. And being very excited about my discovery I
          decided to search for something. When I clicked on it nothing happened
          because the computer was not connected to any network but for a moment
          I thought that I broke something in the computer because I was
          thinking that you can install the "Internet" on your computer like all
          the other programs. I came to my parents with this story and they
          explained to me that the internet is not just one program.

        <h2>
          I believe my first interaction with the web was in my father's office
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be honest I don't remember the first time I used the internet
          because as I remember it always was there. Though, I remember some
          funny stories about how I was learning to understand what is it and
          how it works. So I am going to write about one of them.
          <br />
          I believe my first interaction with the web was in my father's office
          when they first installed a computer with windows95. I believe when
          the browser opened it was empty and then we would go to websites like
          <a href="https://www.sina.com/" target="_blank">sina.com </a> ,
          <a href="https://es.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">yahoo.com </a> or
          <a href="http://www.sohu.com/" target="_blank">sohu.com </a> , which
          were the main digital publisher at the time (of course I had no idea
          what "digital publisher" meant at the time). I remember the "minimize"
          and "close" button on the top left (or right?) Was quite confusing,
          and my father was freaked out when he saw the window disappeared after
          I clicked on "_". He would think I "broke" the computer. <br />
          It was all text on the webpage, sight a few images, which we would
          click with the mouse to get to the content. It was kind of like
          reading newspapers and magazines, just with a bit more contents. The
          navigation was a bit confusing (or computers in general), that we
          would close the browser and reopen it to get to the content on the
          same website if we were "lost" and couldn't find our way back to the
          main page. Back button, refresh button were magic to us and we were so
          scared just to use them too often, feeling it was like reusing a
          physical object which would eventually wear out and the computer will
          break down. <br />
          Internet Explorer was, of course, the only way of browsing. The blue
          "e" icon was like a window to the world, center of the action, which
          magic happens when double clicked on.

        <p>
          I don't remember any remarkable first interactions with the web, but I
          remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth. We
          exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc. I always got so
          frustrated when my Bluetooth didn't work, which was almost always. But
          I got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my
          own as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song
          that I received. This feeling of being able to share something with
          your friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a
          computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.

        <p>
          I got my first computer in 2005. Operation System was Windows XP but
          the internet very very low speed. Was called Dial-Up modem which made
          creepy sounds and if someone calling, the internet immediately shot
          down) After one year, finally we have wi-fi router. One friend told me
          Microsoft introduced a new operation system Windows 7. I looked in
          Microsoft website (and yes it was my first web site) and I saw that
          Microsoft offers to download a new Windows Media Player free. It took
          me almost 4 hours to get the .exe file. When I installed NEW WMP. That
          was a very different design from Windows XP and I liked it. At that
          moment I realized that web it's powerful "tool".

        <p>
          I can remember quite well the first time that I used the web since I
          was actually waiting for finally "getting installed the internet" on
          my computer.
          <br />
          It was in 2000 and I had to dial in via a modem (I'm old enough to
          remember the pre-flat rate time) and I couldn't wait to create an
          E-Mail account for being able to send my very first E-Mail to the only
          other one of my classmates that had Internet already at this time.
          <br />
          Funnily this new way of communication & connecting people that the
          Internet provided was the most exciting purpose for me and shortly
          after we discovered the world of chatrooms and were totally amazed of
          the possibility to talk to people somewhere in real-time.
